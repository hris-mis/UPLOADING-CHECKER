# TypeScript Schedule Checker

This is your fully set up TypeScript version.

## 🧩 Folder structure
```
typescript_project_ready/
│
├── src/
│   └── mainscript.ts
│
├── dist/               ← Compiled JS goes here
│
├── css/
│   └── style.css
│
├── index.html          ← Updated to load dist/mainscript.js

## ⚙️ How to build and run

1. Open terminal in this folder.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```
3. Vite will serve your site, and the TypeScript will be automatically compiled into `dist/mainscript.js`.

You can delete your old `js/` folder after verifying everything works.
